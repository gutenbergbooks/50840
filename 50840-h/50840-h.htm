<p>The movement for the education of girls is of recent
growth, dating back less than a century, to the decade 1840-50.
Before that time there was no public provision for them,
educational endowments being used for boys only. The
earliest tangible sign of the progress of the movement was
the foundation in London of Queen's College, Bedford
College and the North London Collegiate School for Girls,
and in the provinces of the Cheltenham Ladies' College.
This inaugurated the era of public secondary education for
girls, who now have their large, well-equipped schools in
every town.</p>

<p>At first the education given was necessarily very simple;
but as the schoolgirls of the new age grew up, the need for
a more extended training became apparent. It was met
partly by an extension of the teaching given in certain of
the schools; partly by the establishment of a system of
lectures for older girls, notably at Queen's College, London,
and in Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester. Before long it
became clear that some more systematic higher education
must be provided, and efforts were made to enlist the
sympathies of the Universities. University professors undertook
to repeat their lectures for the benefit of girls; but the
number of girls was for some time too few to finance these
schemes, and it was apparent that either their numbers must
be increased by the provision of residence, or expenses must
be reduced by obtaining the admission of girls to the classes
held for men. Both measures were attempted. A residential
College for girls was established at Hitchin (1869), afterwards
removed to Girton, near Cambridge (1873); Newnham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Hall (later "College") was founded in Cambridge in 1871;
and in Oxford, Lady Margaret Hall (1878) and Somerville
Hall (later "College") (1879). Before long residence in or
near London was provided by Bedford College, Westfield
College, and the Royal Holloway College at Englefield
Green in Surrey.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a great impetus had been given in 1878 to
the higher education of women throughout England by the
opening to them of the examinations and degrees of the
University of London. This University was at that time
purely an examining body, and teaching had to be provided
locally; but the possibility of obtaining the hall-mark of a
University degree greatly increased the number of girls seeking
instruction in the provincial towns, and many institutions
gradually opened their doors, among the first being
Owens College, afterwards the University of Manchester.
At Glasgow, Queen Margaret College, availing itself largely
of the services of University lecturers, was founded in 1883.</p>

<p>Further advance was marked by the statutory permission
given in 1892 to the Scottish Universities, granting them
power to admit women to graduation and to provide for
their instruction. And in 1893 the Royal Charter for the
new University of Wales definitely enacted that women
should be eligible for all privileges accorded to men. Every
University incorporated since that date has adopted a
similar enactment. The last two strongholds of masculine
privilege, Oxford and Cambridge, held out for many years.
Quite recently, in 1920, Oxford has capitulated with a whole-hearted
grace, which has won for this ancient University the
gratitude of all women. Cambridge alone now still refuses
to women the privilege of membership and graduation, but
it cannot be long before there also admission will be granted.
One may safely prophesy that the completion of the century
(1940) will see the admission of women to full University
rights.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Except a few privileges likely for some time to be reserved for men
at Oxford and Cambridge, and certain which cannot legally be bestowed
(<i>e.g.</i>, scholarships with special trust deeds limiting them to men).</p>

<p>Elementary education is entirely free in public schools,
supported jointly by the State and the Municipal and County
Councils. Many of the good Secondary Schools, moreover,
have preparatory departments, in which fees are charged;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
and there is a large number of private Kindergarten and other
Preparatory Schools, charging small fees and offering a
mediocre education. Middle-class parents prefer to send
their children to these rather than to the public Elementary
Schools, fearing possible contamination to morals and
manners in the latter.</p>

<p>Secondary education in England and Wales is carried
on in several classes of institution.</p>
<ul>
<li>1. "High Schools," under the management of specially
established educational corporations, pioneers in
secondary education.</li>

<li>2. Endowed Schools—few in number for girls.</li>

<li>3. Municipal or County Schools—some for girls only,
others for girls and boys. These have usually been
started on a lower educational level; but they are
rapidly improving, and many of them now give an
education quite equal to that given by the good
High Schools which led the way.</li>

<li>4. Private Schools; of which some are expensive, and
excellently equipped and staffed; others expensive
and poorly provided, relying mainly on their social
prestige; others inexpensive and poor.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many parents of the more wealthy or aristocratic
families still entrust the education of their girls to private
governesses, from whom they require chiefly a knowledge of
languages and the usages of polite society, supplemented,
perhaps, by music and painting. The movement for the
more complete education of women has not as yet gained
much strength among those sections of society in which a
girl is not expected to earn her own living.</p>

<p>Teachers of the public schools are for the most part
prepared professionally, after completing their Secondary
School course, at special Training Colleges, supported by
State and Municipal grants—in some cases supplemented by
fees from the student. This professional course for teachers
in Elementary Schools covers two years. In a few of the
Universities also, arrangements are made for a two-year
course; in others, however, only teachers for Secondary
Schools are now prepared. These study first for their
degree (Bachelor) during three years, following this up by a
fourth year devoted to professional training. During the
whole course the University fees are paid by the State
through the Board of Education, and a substantial grant is
made to the student for maintenance. Many women who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
could not otherwise meet the expense of a University career
are thus enabled, at the cost of undertaking to teach for a
certain number of years, to pass through the University
practically without expense.</p>

<p>In some Universities, and particularly in those which
still offer a two-year training course for teachers in Elementary
Schools, the "training students" form a class somewhat
apart from the others, regarded as to some extent
socially, and perhaps also intellectually, inferior. In others
no distinction whatever exists, except that the "training"
student has to satisfy the fairly stringent regulations of the
Board of Education, in regard to making satisfactory progress
year by year.</p>

<p>Teachers in the preparatory departments of Secondary
Schools have usually received a thorough professional training;
but those in the small private Kindergartens have commonly
very meagre qualifications.</p>

<p>In the better schools the education of girls is good, and
though there is cause for complaint as to "overpressure,"
attention is given to the physical condition of the pupils; of
late, it is becoming customary to have girls medically examined
at school from time to time. Science and Mathematics
are often not as well taught as in boys' and mixed schools;
but the teaching has rapidly improved during the last
decade, and a good deal of practical work is always included.
In languages, much headway has been made and
new methods are earnestly followed; but the general level of
linguistic study is still below that in most continental countries.
The general level of Secondary education is good;
but the schools suffer from a multiplicity of external examinations,
for which public opinion compels them to prepare
pupils.</p>

<p>The more advanced pupils are prepared for the Entrance
Examinations (usually called Matriculation) of the different
Universities, and they afterwards compete for one of the
many scholarships offered by the local educational authorities
or by the Universities. Competition for these is very keen.
Recently an examination of higher standard—for the
"Higher Certificate"—has been instituted by the Board of
Education, preparation for which is regarded as carrying
on the school education to a level comparable with that of
the first year at the University. It is still, however, in an
experimental stage, and the amount of recognition to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
awarded by the more conservative Universities is as yet
uncertain.</p>

<p>The Board of Education is the Government Department,
which concerns itself with the education of both boys
and girls in all stages. It maintains an army of Inspectors,
men and women, for schools of all types; it conducts examinations
for Secondary Schools; and it makes arrangements,
through Training Colleges founded by various bodies, for
the professional training of teachers for both Elementary
and Secondary Schools. It works for the most part through
locally appointed Education Committees, paying grants to
them for all Schools and Training Colleges under their control.
It lays down a scale (or rather scales) of salaries to be
paid to teachers in various types of Public School. The
Board also undertakes, when requested, to inspect and certify
as "efficient" schools privately conducted, but it does not
exercise any supervision over the larger number of such
schools. Recent regulations, raising the salaries of teachers
in "State-aided" Schools, and providing good pensions,
are likely to crush out of existence many of the less efficient
of the private schools; some educationalists fear that even
the more efficient may now find it difficult to secure good
teachers; and they hold that in that case, valuable freedom
of initiative in education may be lost to the nation.</p>

<p>The University Training Departments in the larger
Universities regard it as part of their natural function to
initiate new and experimental methods in education; and
some of them have special schools established for the purpose.
Excellent pioneer work of the kind is described in
the records of the Fielden School, under the University of
Manchester. This University has established a Faculty of
Education, in which one of the Professors devotes his whole
time to the superintendence of the work of students for
the research degree of Master of Education.</p>

<p><i>The Government and the Universities.</i>—Universities in
Great Britain enjoy a very considerable amount of freedom;
in fact, the curriculum may be said to be entirely in the
hands of the Academic Governing Body (called in most
modern Universities, The Senate, but passing under various
titles in the older Universities). Only such institutions as
are incorporated by a University Charter from Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
may grant degrees, but enactments in matters academic
are made by the University itself, under the constitution
as laid down in each Charter. The Government, through
the Board of Education, makes yearly grants to Universities
and Colleges; but it has hitherto refrained from laying
down any stringent conditions as to the precise use made
of them. The amount of the Government grant is however
very small as compared with what is given in other countries,
and higher education has to depend very largely
upon endowment by private benefactors, with some support
from municipal grants. The present critical state of
national and private finance, together with the largely increased
demand for higher education, has brought about
in all Universities something like a serious financial crisis—for
which at the present moment no adequate remedy
appears.</p>

<p><i>Universities and Colleges.</i>—There are no degree-giving
Colleges in the United Kingdom; all degree-giving institutions
are called Universities. Colleges are institutions too
much specialised or too incomplete to be incorporated as
Universities in themselves; they may form parts of a
University, or may be independent. There are no degree-giving
institutions for women only, as in the United States.</p>

        College.</li>

        <li>In the National University of Ireland:—University

        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>(2) Independent Colleges.
      <ul>

        <li>Girton College, Newnham College—preparing
        for the degree examinations of Cambridge
        University.</li>

        <li>The Imperial College of Science and Technology
        (London)—preparing for its own
        Diplomas.</li>

        <li>Exeter, Nottingham, Reading, Southampton
        Colleges—preparing for the degrees of the

      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where there are various Colleges within the University,
it is customary to make application for admission to the
University through the College selected.</p>

<p>Queen Margaret College is the name given to the
women's side of the University of Glasgow; all applications
from women for entrance to the University must be made
through the College.</p>

<p>In Cambridge, all women students must be members
of either Girton or Newnham College, and can only receive
permission to attend University lectures or examinations
through the College.</p>

<p>In Oxford, the body of Home Students ranks as a
College, and has a Principal.</p>

<p>The following Universities are ancient foundations:—Cambridge,
Oxford, Durham, Aberdeen, St. Andrews,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast (Queen's College), and
Dublin (Trinity College). The other Universities are
grouped together as "Modern." The Scottish Universities,
however, being chiefly non-residential, and situated in large
cities, have many features in common with the modern
group.</p>

<p><i>Teaching System.</i>—At Oxford and Cambridge the
system is a combination of University, Inter-Collegiate and
College lectures, classes and seminars, with individual
teaching. Each undergraduate student is under the personal
guidance of a tutor or director of studies, who plans
out her course of work for term and vacations, supervises
her studies, advises her as to lectures, teaches her, either
alone or with others, and arranges, if necessary, for additional
tuition. Great importance is attached to written
work (consisting in Oxford mainly of essays, in Cambridge
in answers to question papers), and to a close personal
relation between teacher and pupil. This system has
obvious advantages to the student, as the tutor has scope
for developing individual capacity, but it makes considerable
demands upon the tutor's time. Science students are
admitted to the University laboratories, both in Cambridge
and in Oxford, and in the former University, Natural
Science is one of the subjects most popular and important.
Advanced students obtain advice and supervision in their
work from Professors and other specialists.</p>

<p>In other Universities, instruction is carried on mainly
by means of lectures; the amount of written work is smaller,
and there is practically no "coaching," either of individuals
or of small groups—except where the number studying a
given subject is extremely small. There is a trend of
opinion in favour of the appointment of Tutors to give
general guidance to those wishing for it, but the expense
at present bars any innovation on a large scale in this
direction. Some of the residential Halls provide tutors for
their students. In all scientific subjects a considerable
amount of practical work in the laboratories is required of
the student, with more or less individual guidance from
the Demonstrators in charge of the laboratories.</p>

<p>It is the vice of most of the modern Universities to
require attendance at too large a number of lectures, leaving
too little time for study and thought. And though the
evil is readily recognised, and efforts are made from time
to time to reduce the amount of attendance required, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
zeal and autocratic power of the Professor in charge of
any given subject has usually succeeded in defeating them.</p>

<p>In English Universities it is customary to call courses
for a first degree either Honours or Pass Courses. The
Honours Course is specialised—only one subject (say, a language
or a science) with a minimum amount of one or two
related subjects. A Pass Course is more general. Both
types of Course cover, as a rule, a period of three years
before the Final Degree Examination; which may, or may
not, be preceded by subsidiary examinations in the earlier
years. It is the rule in most of the Women's Colleges in
Cambridge and Oxford that Honours Examinations only
may be prepared for; in other Universities and Colleges,
the women, like the men, can choose between Honours and
Pass. There has been of late years a growing tendency
to choose the more specialised course; it has more prestige,
and the Headmistresses of Girls' Secondary Schools have
preferred specialists as teachers. But there are slight indications
that this preference is becoming less marked; and
there may possibly before long be seen a revival of the
demand for a more general education—which is manifestly
suited to certain types of mind.</p>

<p><i>Degrees.</i>—The degrees conferred by the Universities
are those of Bachelor, Master, and Doctor. Not all of these
degrees, are, however, conferred in every Faculty. The
Course for a Bachelor's degree usually covers three years<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a
href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>;
the Master's degree is sometimes (as in Oxford and Cambridge)
conferred for a payment without further examination;
sometimes, as in most of the modern Universities, it
requires a further examination; in Scottish Universities it
is the first degree, obtained after three years' study. Hence
this degree connotes a surprising variety of attainment.
The Doctor's degree is in all Universities awarded only
upon the production of original work which can be regarded
as a serious contribution to knowledge.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> In Cambridge the examination for the first degree is called the
"Tripos"; in Oxford it is called "Schools."</p>
</div>

<p>Recently every University has created a Ph.D. degree,
open to graduates of any approved institution, British or
foreign. It is given for advanced work only, the results
of which must be embodied in a dissertation; and study
must have been prosecuted during the greater part of two
(or three) years in the University conferring the degree.
It may be conferred in any Faculty. Many of the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
higher degrees, M.A., M.Sc., B.Litt., etc., etc., are also
open to graduates from other approved institutions.</p>

<p>The Imperial College of Science and Technology,
London, holds a special position among independent Colleges,
granting a diploma of its own which is regarded
as equal in standard to a University degree.</p>

<p><i>Subjects Studied.</i>—The greater number of women
students enter the Faculty of Arts, but large numbers also
enter for Science and for Medicine; a few for Commerce,
Technology, Law, etc. The study of Medicine can now
be carried on under the same conditions as for men in
practically all the modern Universities. In some, however,
situated in comparatively small towns, the clinical facilities
are inadequate, and it is customary to continue clinical
study in one of the larger Medical Schools, London, Edinburgh,
Glasgow, Liverpool, or Manchester. Edinburgh,
with a long-established prestige in medicine, attracts large
numbers of students. Tradition inherited from early days
of controversy has long limited the opportunities of women
in Edinburgh, but a more liberal policy now admits them
to substantial privileges.</p>

<p>In London, the position of medical study is peculiar.
It is mainly in the hands of ancient Medical Schools, each
with its own large Hospital—Bartholomew's, St. George's,
Guy's, St. Thomas's, Westminster, etc.—out of which, in
fact, the Teaching School has developed. These great
Medical Schools followed the policy of the University of
Edinburgh, opposing to the admission of women such relentless
hostility that eventually the women had to create and
finance a separate school. Thus came into being the London
School of Medicine for Women, which succeeded in making
a working arrangement for clinical instruction at the Royal
Free Hospital. Though women are now admitted to the
Medical Schools of University and King's Colleges, and
the Charing Cross Hospital, most of the great Hospital
Medical Schools are still closed to them, and the London
School of Medicine for Women remains the chief centre
for the medical education of women in London.</p>

<p>Pharmacy is taught at most of the Universities, but
all pharmacists must prepare, at the Universities or in
special schools, for examinations held by an outside body—the
Pharmaceutical Society. Degrees in Dentistry are conferred
by some Universities, and an excellent training is
provided, but the profession of Dentistry is still unregulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
by the State, and unqualified persons freely practise. This
makes Dentistry less popular as a profession among persons
of University education; but there is a great field for qualified
dentists, and women would do well to enter upon it in
larger numbers.</p>

<p>Languages studied at the Universities are Greek, Latin,
French, German, Oriental languages, and more recently,
Italian, Spanish, and Russian. The teaching in modern
languages is carried on partly by native, partly by foreign
lecturers; except in Oriental languages, which are practically
always taught by Englishmen. There is a tendency
observable at present in the Secondary Schools, and in the
Universities, to give less attention than hitherto to Greek
and Latin.</p>

<p>Faculties of Commerce have been established in the
great civic Universities of Birmingham and Manchester,
and recently in London; Leeds and Liverpool also give
teaching in Commerce. Economics is a subject of study—sometimes
the subject of an Honours Schools—in most of
the Universities. The London School of Economics has
unrivalled facilities for research and advanced study.</p>

<p>In the Fine Arts there is practically no University
study. Throughout the country there are Schools of Music,
some of which are recognised, as in London and Manchester,
as institutions affiliated to the University; but none
of them are mainly under University control. The Schools
of Art existing in many of the larger cities are also self-governing
institutions. A movement has been set on foot
for bringing some of these into closer connection with the
Universities, and the Slade Art School in London is closely
connected with University College; but on the whole very
little progress has yet been recorded. The nearest approach
to recognition of the existence of the Fine Arts (outside the
Slade School), is the establishment of Schools of Art and
Architecture in the Universities of Liverpool and Manchester,
but these are concerned very largely with Architecture
rather than with the Fine Arts.</p>

<p>The study of Law in England is carried on to some
extent in the Universities, many of which have Faculties of
Law; but the examinations which admit to practice as
Barristers are controlled by the Council of Legal Education
(established by four ancient foundations, the Inns of
Court in London), and those admitting Solicitors are held
by the Law Society. Preparation for these examinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
is mainly post-graduate, and must, in part at least, be
carried on in the Inns of Court or under the Law Society.
Colonial and foreign students may, under certain conditions,
be admitted. The admission of women is of very
recent date. No woman has as yet quite completed all the
formalities entitling her to be "called to the Bar"—that
is, to be recognised as qualified to plead before the Courts;
but a considerable number are now engaged in preparing
for the profession, as solicitors or barristers.</p>

<p>The study of Agriculture, Horticulture and kindred
subjects is provided for in nearly all the Universities, which
maintain their own practical and experimental farms. It
is, however, more usual to pursue these studies in various
independent colleges, where practical work plays a larger
part than scientific training. For women there are, among
others, Horticultural Colleges at Swanley and at Studley,
and the Edinburgh School of Gardening for Women. These
colleges for the most part prepare pupils for the examinations
of the Royal Horticultural Society. The University
College of Reading makes special provision for education
in Horticulture and Agriculture, which is rendered valuable
by close co-operation with the Department of Science; and
the College awards its own Diploma.</p>

<p>Physical Culture.—Very little attention is at present
paid by University authorities to physical training and
education, no University giving a professional training in
physical culture. For women a number of independent
Colleges provide full courses of instruction suited to prepare
teachers in the subject; for men teachers there is practically
no provision. Any systematic teaching in gymnasium
exercise is usually given to men by ex-Army instructors;
coaching in games (football, cricket, rowing, etc.), is given
by special experts. For a nation which, unofficially, attaches
immense importance to physical "fitness" and to athletic
games, the neglect of scientific study of the subject, and
the absence of official provision for systematic exercise, is
astonishing. Universities and Colleges for the most part
limit themselves to supporting financially the provision of
gymnasium and athletic grounds, where such students as
desire if may indulge in open-air games or indoor exercise.
In the residential Universities the early part of the afternoon
is by common consent left free for recreation; but
in the great civic Universities, for the most part non-residential,
this is rendered impossible by the necessity for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
freeing the later afternoon for the return journey of students
from a distance. As a result, large numbers of students
never take any recreative exercise; and for all of them the
possibilities are extremely limited. In these civic Universities,
moreover, the athletic grounds are nearly all inevitably
situated at a considerable distance from the University
buildings. In these circumstances, opportunities for
playing games are practically limited to "match teams,"
the chief game played by women being hockey. The part of
the average student is therefore mainly that of an onlooker,
and this is likely to continue so, unless the Universities
should decide to take more full official direction of the
physical development of their students. There are signs
of a movement towards this; but the difficulties are great,
and very little has been achieved. The Board of Education
has set an example by insisting that all students training
to be teachers, at the Universities or elsewhere, shall take
a minimum of some form of physical exercise.</p>

<p>Social Science.—Several Universities carry on Departments
(or Schools) for the study of Social Science, usually
in close connection with University Settlements and with
such organisations for charity and relief as exist in the
district. Women enter these "Schools" in some number;
since there are many openings for them as organising secretaries,
and some few as investigators into social conditions.
Birmingham, Glasgow, and Liverpool are good
centres for this study; and the London School of Economics
offers an excellent training in methods of research.</p>

<p>Household Economics.—Very little has as yet been
done by the Universities for this subject of study. Most
of the large cities support Municipal Schools of Domestic
Economy; but these are unconnected with the Universities,
and give a training which is purely practical. It is much
to be desired that encouragement should be given to a more
scientific study of questions of nutrition and diet, and
methods of institutional management. The only institution
of University rank concerning itself with this study is
King's College for Women (Household and Social Science
Department), London.</p>

<p>The study of Education has already been discussed.</p>

<p><i>Sessions and Terms.</i>—The whole period of study in
any given year is called a Session, and the session usually
consists of three terms—Michaelmas, Lent, and Easter (or
Summer)—each of about ten or eleven weeks. In Cambridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
however, the terms are about nine weeks each, and
in Oxford, eight. Terms in Faculties of Medicine (and
Dentistry) are often longer than in other Faculties; and in
Scotland, some Faculties still adhere to the old plan of
two terms. The session begins in October.</p>

<p>There are vacations at Christmas and at Easter, dividing
the terms, and varying in length from a fortnight to
four or five weeks. In the Long Vacation (July to
September) there is no systematic instruction for the
ordinary University student, though from time to time
"summer schools" are held for students from outside,
more especially in Universities situated in an attractive
environment. In Cambridge there is also a Long Vacation
term, during which tuition is given, without lectures, to
those University students who desire it.</p>

<p>Lectures are usually given and laboratory work done
in the morning and afternoon; in Faculties of Commerce
there are also evening lectures.</p>

<p><i>Women on the Staff.</i>—In spite of the fact that, nominally
at least, professorial appointments have now been open
to women for a good many years, very few women professors
have as yet been appointed. There are two or
three in Departments of Education; women have quite
recently been appointed to professorial chairs in French
and Italian; and the National University of Ireland has
appointed one or two women. Oxford, opened to women
only in 1920, has already a woman as Acting-Professor
of French. But the number of women professors is still
disappointingly few; and it is difficult to say whether the
chief cause is lack of applications from women or prejudice
on the part of appointing bodies; both causes undoubtedly
operate.</p>

<p>Women lecturers are not so rare, though their numbers
are still comparatively small. They are most numerous in
Education, but are appointed also in other Faculties, salaries
being the same as for men. The main avenue to University
teaching for women lies through the Colleges for women
only, where they, of course, form the entire residential staff;
the tutorial system of Cambridge and Oxford thus affords
employment in higher teaching to a considerable number
of women. Further, the residential Halls attached to the
mixed Universities provide posts of responsibility and prestige
for a considerable number of educated women as
Wardens or Principals. The recognition accorded to these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
officials by the University itself is, however, not always entirely
satisfactory.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, the present position of women upon
the staffs of the Universities and Colleges is one of comparative
subordination. Very few occupy senior posts of
importance and prestige. Except in the Women's Colleges,
the higher direction of the teaching and the general administration
are still almost wholly in the hands of men;
and this is the case even where, as in Wales, the number
of men and women students is fairly equal.</p>

<p>On account of the comparative scarcity of women in
senior positions, it is usual in most non-residential Colleges
and Universities to employ some senior woman as a member
of the administrative staff, charged with the duty of superintending
the general welfare of the women students.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a
href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Her
status and duties vary greatly—from those of a mere
chaperon to those of a Senior authority, consulted in all
matters concerning women students individually and collectively,
and responsible for making representations as to any
matter, academic or social, affecting them. It is partially
realised that women students, having often received a different
education from that given to boys and having the
prospect of other careers and other spheres of work, may
be specially affected by academic legislation; and in matters
of building and equipment their needs are always to some
extent special. The most enlightened Universities and
Colleges therefore afford considerable powers and status to
this woman official (who is known by various titles—Dean,
Senior Tutor, Censor, etc). In residential Universities the
Heads of the Women's Colleges have the necessary academic
information, official status, and knowledge of their students'
needs.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> There are, however, some eight or nine exceptions. The Association
of Head Mistresses has asked that some such official shall be appointed
wherever there are women students.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Residence.</i>—All Universities and Colleges (except the
University of London on its external side) require students
to live in the district and to receive instruction or guidance
in the institution itself. Certain Universities and Colleges
also require all students to be members of organised bodies,
for the most part resident in Colleges or Halls.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a
href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the case in Cambridge and in Oxford. In London, Bedford,
Holloway, and Westfield Colleges are largely or
mainly residential. The University College of Wales,
Aberystwyth, is, for women, entirely residential; and the
University College of Reading requires both men and
women to live in Halls. All the other Universities (except
Aberdeen) have Halls, large or small, for women students,
but do not compel residence. Lists of Halls can be obtained
from the University prospectuses; and applications for
residence (as distinct from entrance to the University) should
be made direct to the various Wardens or Principals. The
demand for accommodation is everywhere very great; and
it is practically impossible to secure admission unless application
is made at least a year in advance. It is usually
a great additional benefit for foreign students to reside
in a Hall; and every effort should be made to secure provisional
acceptance beforehand.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> In regard to the meaning the terms 'College' and 'Hall,' it may
be said that (except in Oxford) the 'Hall' provides residence only;
the 'College' provides teaching, and arranges for admission into the
University, while it may, or may not, also provide residence.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Discipline</i> varies from one University to another—from
the comparatively strict discipline necessitated in old
Universities with a long tradition of obedience and convention;
or in smaller Universities which are the centre of
interest in small towns such as Reading and Aberystwyth;
to the freedom of the great civic University, compelled to
accord almost complete social liberty to the large numbers
of men and women living in their own homes; and comfortably
sheltered from censorious criticism among the many
more exciting attractions existing in every great city. In
some Universities men and women students may not converse
together in the streets; in others they may freely meet,
walk, take meals, and study together.</p>

<p>In all Universities and Colleges there is much <i>Social
Intercourse</i> and gaiety. Dancing is very frequent; dramatic
performances, debates (for one sex only, or mixed) are
common; and almost every Honours School or Department
has its Society for the encouragement of its special subject,
and the promotion of social intercourse among its members.
Even in Oxford and Cambridge some of these Societies
include both men and women.</p>

<p>Residential Colleges and Halls usually provide
"Common" (or "Combination") Rooms where staff or
students can meet each other; and the mixed Universities
set apart rooms, usually separate for men and for women,
for the hours of the day not devoted to study. These
may be simply sitting-rooms with restaurant attached, as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the smaller institutions, or may be, in the more established
modern Universities, large, well-furnished Union Buildings
or club-houses, as provided in Edinburgh, Liverpool, or
Manchester. The management of these Unions, as to both
finance and discipline, is usually in the hands of the
students themselves. In no University, however, does the
<i>accommodation for women</i> compare in dignity, commodiousness,
or spaciousness with that provided in many American
institutions. With the exception of some of the oldest
Universities, where the provision for men is ample and
beautiful, University and College buildings in Great Britain
are upon a wholly different scale from those in the United
States. While laboratories are often excellently equipped,
libraries and lecture-rooms are not infrequently inadequate,
and the provision for recreation, physical well-being, and
social intercourse is sometimes seriously wanting. Nothing
exists in our modern Universities at all comparable with the
magnificent buildings, the extensive grounds, woods and
lakes, the immense gymnasiums and swimming baths, provided
for women students in the United States. And in the
older of our civic Universities, the cramped conditions of
existence in the midst of an immense city are responsible
for the absence of many social amenities. In the smaller,
younger Universities an attempt is being made to secure
more space for future development before it is too late;
but the standards even there are far below those known
in the United States. English girls of aristocratic or
wealthy parentage do not as yet go to the University in
large numbers; most of the students come from homes of
limited means, and their demands, except in the matter of
education pure and simple, are modest. At the same time,
one never hears of students, as in American Colleges,
paying their expenses by giving personal service; it would,
in fact, be very difficult for the average student to spare
sufficient time from her studies, which are exacting enough
to leave her only the minimum amount of leisure essential
for recreation.</p>

<p><i>Finance</i> is a matter for serious concern in our Universities,
largely dependent as they are upon small public
grants and private benefactions; and in Women's Colleges
and Halls this question is still more pressing. It should be
remembered that the numbers in our Women's Colleges are
small; all the five Women's Colleges together in Oxford
do not number 700 students. Moreover, though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
generous benefactor exists in this country, his gifts are on
a comparatively modest scale, and institutions specially for
women do not attract the largest.</p>

<p><i>Libraries.</i>—The most complete collections of books are
those of the privileged libraries, the British Museum Library,
the Bodleian (Oxford), the Cambridge University Library,
the Advocates' Library (Edinburgh), the Trinity College
Library (Dublin), and, more recently, the National Library
of Wales. Each of these is privileged to receive a copy
of every book published in Great Britain. Other valuable
libraries are those of the London School of Economics, and
the School of Oriental Studies (London). In Manchester
a rich storehouse of early printed books, mediaeval manuscripts,
and general literature is provided by the lavishly
endowed John Rylands Library, the ancient Chetham
Library, the University (Christie) Library, and the Municipal
Reference Library.</p>

<p><i>Expenses.</i>—University education in Great Britain is
not free, as in some countries; although in the case of a
certain number of students, Government grants or local
scholarships cover the expenses more or less completely. It
is extremely difficult to give any figures as to the cost of
a University training, on account of the great difference
in the fees and the general absence of any inclusive charge.
It is, moreover, to be noted that, where the University includes
several Colleges, there are often both College fees
and University fees. The fees for residence in College,
again, may or may not include also the fees for tuition and
lectures. Life at Cambridge is, for women, rather more
expensive than in other Universities; but in Oxford it is
less expensive to be a member of the Society of Home
Students than to reside in a College, and in Cambridge
the small number of older students permitted by the Colleges
to be "out-students" can live more cheaply. Again,
the extreme brevity of the terms in Cambridge and Oxford
entails heavy vacation expenses for the foreign student.</p>

<p>At Oxford and Cambridge the cost of board, lodging
and tuition for the session, consisting of three terms of eight
to nine weeks each, varies from £135 to £150.</p>

<p>Next in order of expense comes London, where the
fees for residence in College, apart from tuition, are £90
to £100. In the larger University cities of England, residence
costs about £70; in the smaller places, in Wales
and in Scotland, it is lower (£40 to £50).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>Where the fees for guidance or tuition in advanced
work are charged separately from those for residence, they
vary from £5 to £15 in the Faculty of Arts; in the Faculty
of Science they usually depend on the nature of the practical
work involved. For the examination of these the
charge may be from £5 to £10, and for the conferment
of the degree from £5 to £20.</p>



<hr class="chap" /><div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak"><a name="CAREERS_FOR_UNIVERSITY_WOMEN" id="CAREERS_FOR_UNIVERSITY_WOMEN">CAREERS FOR UNIVERSITY WOMEN.</a></h2></div>


<p>Most of the women students in British Universities are
intending to earn their living; the exceptions being a few
at Oxford and Cambridge. The careers most fully open
to them are teaching and medicine, for which full professional
training is provided in the Universities. A
large army of women graduates is employed in the
Secondary Schools, and many women doctors hold positions
in hospitals, especially in those for women and children,
or carry on private practice. Pharmacy is chosen as an
occupation by many women, and in dentistry there is plenty
of room—though very few women enter upon it.</p>

<p>Students showing marked talent fairly often obtain
grants enabling them to prosecute research for a year or
two; a few private commercial firms employ research workers
and occasionally engage a woman; but the opportunities of
this kind are comparatively rare. A certain number of
women in practically every University now hold positions
as Demonstrators in laboratories, or as Assistant Lecturers
or Lecturers; a very few are Professors. Some are employed
as lecturers under organisations for extending advanced
teaching outside the Universities.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a
href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Such are the Workers' Educational Association, and the various
University Extension Schemes.</p>
</div>

<p>In the Civil Service (which is the general name for the
various departments of work under the Government), University
women are employed in some numbers under the Board
of Education, the Home Office, the Ministry of Health and
the Local Government Board, as Inspectors and Medical
Officers. The Ministry of Labour and the Post Office, while
employing large numbers of women, offer very few posts
suitable for University graduates. During the war many
women held in Government offices positions of importance
and responsibility; but most of them have now been dispensed
with under the plea of economy, or of providing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
employment for discharged soldiers. A very few of these
women, however, still retain their posts, and there is a
fairly powerful movement for opening the higher positions
in the Civil Service to women. Hitherto all women employed
have been engaged by individual selection; it is now
proposed that after three years from 1921, they shall be
eligible to compete for posts in the same examinations as
men, though power is to be retained to appoint to any
given post either a man or a woman, as may seem best,
from among the successful candidates. It remains to be
seen to what extent this provision may be used to nullify
the chances of women. There is powerful opposition in
many Government departments; but the Treasury is said
to be favourable to the gradual introduction of women in
higher administrative positions. At present, such openings
for them are few. It is not at present even proposed to
open to them positions in diplomacy or in the consulate.</p>

<p>A considerable number of educated women find
administrative positions as Heads of University Colleges,
Halls of Residence, and Training Colleges for Teachers.
Some of the older Training Colleges are still presided over
by men as Principals; but it is the policy of the Board of
Education to replace these upon retirement by women. All
Heads and Assistants in Elementary and Secondary Schools
for girls only are women; but in schools open to both boys
and girls, it is customary to appoint a man as Head, with
or without a senior woman in special charge of the girls.
In Scotland it is still common for a girls' school to have
a Headmaster.</p>

<p>Secretarial work is a career coveted by many University
graduates unwilling to enter upon the occupation of teaching.
The Universities do not, however, provide a professional
training for this; nor are the openings suited for
University women very numerous. Some occasionally find
congenial posts as foreign correspondents in banks and
commercial firms; many become organising secretaries for
philanthropic or kindred organisations; a favoured few
become private secretaries to literary, scientific, or political
personages. The demand, however, for secretaries of
University education is not at this moment equal to the
supply.</p>

<p>The Church offers at present very little scope for women:
except in one or two of the free sects, the ministry is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
open to them. The Law has only within the last year or
two been opened to them.</p>

<p>Librarianship offers a very limited number of opportunities.
Some College and University libraries employ a
few women in comparatively subordinate positions; the
ordinary City Library does not offer any opening to women
of University education. An attempt has recently been
made to provide a professional training for Librarians,
following the example set long ago by the United States;
but for women the prospects seem at present precarious.</p>

<p>Home Economics and Domestic Science being (with
the exception noted above) still outside the purview of the
Universities, practically no University women are qualified
to undertake posts either as teachers or as practical workers
in this sphere. There is, however, a very large demand
for highly qualified Institutional Managers, Matrons, Superintendents,
etc., and good salaries can be earned in such
positions. It is to be hoped that with the return of better
financial prospects in the Universities, advanced training in
work of this kind, eminently suitable for educated women,
may be undertaken.</p>

<p>It will be seen that, though many careers are open
to University women, the prizes are few; and in very many
of these careers the openings are so rare, or the initial
income offered so low, that only those who are adventurous
or independent financially, can afford to run the risk involved
in choosing them. By far the most usual occupation
for them, apart from medicine, is the profession of teaching;
although it is now by no means, as at one time, the only
avenue open. During the war, women teachers entered
boys' schools in considerable numbers, but, except for quite
young boys, few of these are now retained. Upon the
whole, the outlook is discouraging to those who looked for
a permanent increase in the number of openings for women
as a result of women's varied services in the war. Only
a few positions of importance have been retained, and
throughout the whole field of labour women have lost the
greater part of the advance made. All that seems to be
definitely gained at present is the breaking down of the
bar of absolute exclusion.</p>

<p>Women students wishing to enter any University in
Great Britain should have complete command of the English
language, since this is pre-supposed in all University studies.
In none of the Universities is any course arranged specially
for foreign students (though occasionally summer schools
suitable for foreigners are held); but, provided they can
pass the Entrance Examinations, foreigners are accepted
as students in the ordinary courses. It is not, however,
as a rule very practicable for a foreigner to pass one of these
Entrance Examinations—planned as they are for British
boys and girls leaving school. By far the best plan is to
study first at a home University and resort to this country
only for post-graduate work. The student should forward
to the proper authority (usually the Registrar) an application
for admission giving full information as to her previous
University studies, with examinations passed, etc.;
and each application is usually considered entirely upon its
merits. As a rule, any candidate who can give proof of
having attained a standard equivalent to that of the first
degree examination may hope for admission without further
test. The studies of all such post-graduate students are
directed individually by the Professor of the subject concerned;
and it is advisable to communicate with him before
actually applying for admission to the College or University.
The most suitable degree for such students to work for
is the Ph.D., open in any Faculty. Nearly all Universities
publish special prospectuses giving details as to the facilities
provided for research and advanced work.</p>

<p><i>Scholarships and Fellowships.</i>—There is only one
Fellowship definitely set aside to be awarded to foreign
students—the John W. Garrett International Fellowship in
Bacteriology, offered by the University of Liverpool to
students from the United States or other foreign countries.
In several Universities, however, scholarships and fellowships
exist which are not limited to students in Great
Britain; and particulars of these can be obtained from
their Scholarship Prospectuses. Candidates from other
countries must, however, produce ample proof of their qualifications,
and are probably at some disadvantage unless
they have studied under professors of world-wide reputation.
In many of the Universities there are endowments
for research open to persons, whether British born or not,
who have already begun work at the University in question.</p>

<p class="center"><i>President</i>:</p>

<p class="center">Professor Caroline Spurgeon, Doc. Univ. Paris,<br />
Hon. Litt.D. (Michigan).</p>

<p>The British Federation of University Women was
formed in 1910, for the purpose of furthering the interests
of University women.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Aims of the Federation.</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. To create an organisation which shall represent University
women in <i>all</i> professions, and enable them to
take concerted action on matters affecting their interests
in public and private life.</p>

<p>2. To promote co-operation between the University women
of Great Britain, and to stimulate friendship between
University women throughout the world.</p>

<p>3. To encourage independent research work by University
women.</p>

<p>4. To stimulate the interest of University women in municipal
and public life.</p>

<p>5. To keep a Register of University women and to notify
them of suitable appointments.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center"><i>Constitution.</i></p>

<p>The British Federation is composed of Local Associations
of University women, the country being divided for
this purpose into areas around different large centres. Local
Associations have been formed in eleven areas, the centre in
each case being a University town. Twenty members is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
minimum required to form a Local Association. These
Associations are free to adopt any objects which are in
accord with the "Aims of the Federation."</p>

<p class="center"><i>Membership.</i></p>

<p>Membership is restricted to women who hold a University
degree or its equivalent. Registered medical women
or registered dentists are qualified for membership.</p>

<p>In addition to regular members the Federation admits
as associates, in certain cases, women who have studied
for not less than two years regularly at a University.
Students in their last year may be admitted as temporary
associates, at the discretion of the Local Association, on
the understanding that they become members after taking
their degree.</p>

<p>Women who have not studied at a University, but
who have advanced the higher education and the interests
of women, may be admitted by the Local Associations as
honorary members.</p>

<p>Neither associates nor honorary members have voting
power.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Annual Meeting.</i></p>

<p>An Annual Meeting of the General Committee is held
during the summer term for the election of the officers of
the Federation and other business. This General Committee
is composed of the members of the Executive Committee
and delegates from each Local Association.</p>

<p>Special meetings may also be called at the request of
the delegates of any three branches.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Executive Committee.</i></p>

<p>The Executive Committee consists of the President,
Hon. Secretaries, Hon. Treasurer, the Chairman of the
Committee on International Relations, the Secretaries of the
British Federation and of the Committee on International
Relations, eight members elected by the General Committee
at the Annual Meeting, and representatives of each Local
Association. The Executive may co-opt four additional
members.</p>

<p>The President may not hold office for more than five
years, and the eight elected members of the Executive retire
annually. No member of the Executive Committee, other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
than the officers, may hold office for more than four consecutive
years.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Finance.</i></p>

<p>Members are admitted to Local Associations on payment
of a small entrance fee (6d.) and either an annual
subscription, varying slightly within the different Associations,
or a uniform life membership subscription of £3 10s.
Annual subscriptions are paid to the local secretaries or
treasurers. Life subscriptions are paid to the central
Treasurer. Each Local Association contributes out of its
annual subscriptions a minimum capitation fee of 4s. per
member to the general funds of the Federation. The
financial year runs from June 1st to May 31st.</p>

<p>The Central Office of the Federation is at 73, Avenue

provide effective machinery for ensuring co-operation between
the national associations of University women in the various
parts of the world. An account of the Conference, including
full reports of speeches by Professor Caroline Spurgeon,

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
